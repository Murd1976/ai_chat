SaaS
In a SaaS company, providing great Customer Support is the key to growth and success. Possibly it is more true for a SaaS company than for any other type of business.Although almost all customer support best practices apply to SaaS customer support, there is one fact about SaaS that changes the whole support experience: SaaS means your product is a tool that needs to be learned.If this is the reason that is keeping you aback to embrace the benefits of outsourcing The Customer Service operation, Maxximize is here to swipe away all your concerns, in the only possible way: a Customer Service Team highly experienced in SaaS business, running the Customer Service for multiple successful SaaS companies.SaaS customer support plays a part in reputation, brand image, loyalty, and customer satisfaction. It’s more than just understanding the functionality of the product, solving bugs, and handling technical issues. It’s about being alongside customers throughout their journey and ensuring they have a positive experience — starting before the sale is even made.SaaS customer support starts with helping prospectsWhen SaaS prospects visit your website, they generally start out on the self-service path. They check out your website, but then they start to have questions. Many will go to the FAQ page to find answers to basic questions, and if you’ve done a good job they will be satisfied.But what if prospects don’t find an answer to their question? That’s when live service becomes a necessity.To ensure prospects have access to instant contact, it’s useful to have live chat, phone, and visual engagement options available. Human-to-human contact reduces customer frustration and enables your business to deliver a good customer experience.Live engagement also helps you learn more about your prospects, including discovering their business needs and problems. The more you know about your prospects, the easier it becomes to develop a demo that meets their specific needs.Once a prospect is ready to move from a trial to a buying phase, you need to be prepared to offer live support. During the onboarding process, walk them through all the steps from signup to activation to training. This can help decrease the drop off rate and ensure a friction-free experience. This extra effort upfront can have long-term benefits, including:Better engagementReduced churnDecrease in future support callsCustomer empowermentThe work for SaaS customer service employees doesn’t end with onboarding. Churn rate is a constant threat.The first step in assuring your customers will remain with you is to monitor what your users are doing and learn where they’re failing and succeeding in the application. There are software solutions that can help with behavioral analysis. The knowledge you can gain from this type of software gives you the opportunity to uncover key problems without waiting for the customer to complain or get frustrated.Customer Relationship Management (CRM)Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)CMS and e-commerce platformsAccounting solutionsProject ManagementEmail MarketingCommunication and Collaboration PlatformsHR/HRM solutions

Marketplace Store
If you’re selling or thinking about selling on Amazon, eBay, Ocado, Walmart or any other marketplace around the world, you really need a partner with years of experience, deep knowledge of the marketplace and the country, full command of the country’s languages.While commerce continues to grow at a steady rate across the globe, leading marketplaces—the likes of ASOS, Zalando and Amazon—are further outpacing market growth averages. 53% of online shoppers are making purchases on marketplaces three or more times per month. One in five people gathers information on Amazon before making an in-store purchase. And Amazon isn’t the only big player on the marketplace scene: Alibaba, AliExpress, Bol.com, OTTO, and even eBay to name just a few. Digital marketplaces are ubiquitous, and their presence is growing steadily.Marketplaces can, therefore, offer you access to a huge base of both existing and new customers. Unsure where to start? Wondering about the best pricing strategy or how to stay on brand? We’re happy to help you get started or to get further.E-commerce marketplaces present opportunities that cannot be ignored. All major and medium size markets have grown to a stage where one or few large marketplaces have gained a predominant market share. Competing against them with an independent web store is feasible only for niche products.But why do you need to fight against these behemoths, if they offer the opportunities to sell on their platforms, with access to their large pool of customers and even their e-commerce infrastructures?These international marketplaces can be considered just as sales channels, additional to your main web store.If you are planning to launch a web store, it is highly recommended to evaluate whether it is more profitable and fast to build a store solely on a large market leader marketplace.International marketplaces are the easiest access to new markets. If you are planning to expand to other countries, launching stores in large e-commerce marketplaces gives you the possibilities to build the store in short time and immediate access to a fully integrated logistic infrastructure, together with a fully developed environment reach of tools to boost your sales.

Crypto
While it seems like cryptocurrency is paving a road ne’er before traveled, this isn’t true in every respect. Although striking renegade financial ground, the industry bares many similarities to other hypergrowth companies. But crypto has suffered worse press when it comes to customer service. Coinbase was condemned for a poor response after users lost thousands of dollars; Binance & Kraken have not escaped the wrath of bad reviews either. Time to mop up the damage.Robinhood added 24-hour support after negative reviews and Support.com launched an on-demand service to handle criticisms for their slow response time. But as a whole, crypto companies need to do a lot, and fast, to keep up with the adoption rate.Crypto minersCrypto ExchangeCrypto TradersCrypto WalletCrypto Payment gatewaysBlockchain financial servicesCrypto Crowdfunding

We analyze, dig out the meaningful data and use them to build new processes.

Possibly it is more true for a SaaS company than for any other type of business.Although almost all customer support best practices apply to SaaS customer support, there is one fact about SaaS that changes the whole support experience: SaaS means your product is a tool that needs to be learned.If this is the reason that is keeping you aback to embrace the benefits of outsourcing The Customer Service operation, Maxximize is here to swipe away all your concerns, in the only possible way: a Customer Service Team highly experienced in SaaS business, running the Customer Service for multiple successful SaaS companies.SaaS customer support plays a part in reputation, brand image, loyalty, and customer satisfaction. It’s more than just understanding the functionality of the product, solving bugs, and handling technical issues. It’s about being alongside customers throughout their journey and ensuring they have a positive experience — starting before the sale is even made.SaaS customer support starts with helping prospectsWhen SaaS prospects visit your website, they generally start out on the self-service path. They check out your website, but then they start to have questions. Many will go to the FAQ page to find answers to basic questions, and if you’ve done a good job they will be satisfied.But what if prospects don’t find an answer to their question? That’s when live service becomes a necessity.To ensure prospects have access to instant contact, it’s useful to have live chat, phone, and visual engagement options available. Human-to-human contact reduces customer frustration and enables your business to deliver a good customer experience.Live engagement also helps you learn more about your prospects, including discovering their business needs and problems. The more you know about your prospects, the easier it becomes to develop a demo that meets their specific needs.Once a prospect is ready to move from a trial to a buying phase, you need to be prepared to offer live support. During the onboarding process, walk them through all the steps from signup to activation to training. This can help decrease the drop off rate and ensure a friction-free experience. This extra effort upfront can have long-term benefits, including:Better engagementReduced churnDecrease in future support callsCustomer empowermentThe work for SaaS customer service employees doesn’t end with onboarding. Churn rate is a constant threat.The first step in assuring your customers will remain with you is to monitor what your users are doing and learn where they’re failing and succeeding in the application.

Marketplace Store
If you’re selling or thinking about selling on Amazon, eBay, Ocado, Walmart or any other marketplace around the world, you really need a partner with years of experience, deep knowledge of the marketplace and the country, full command of the country’s languages.While commerce continues to grow at a steady rate across the globe, leading marketplaces—the likes of ASOS, Zalando and Amazon—are further outpacing market growth averages. 53% of online shoppers are making purchases on marketplaces three or more times per month. One in five people gathers information on Amazon before making an in-store purchase. And Amazon isn’t the only big player on the marketplace scene: Alibaba, AliExpress, Bol.com, OTTO, and even eBay to name just a few. Digital marketplaces are ubiquitous, and their presence is growing steadily.Marketplaces can, therefore, offer you access to a huge base of both existing and new customers. Unsure where to start? Wondering about the best pricing strategy or how to stay on brand? We’re happy to help you get started or to get further.E-commerce marketplaces present opportunities that cannot be ignored. All major and medium size markets have grown to a stage where one or few large marketplaces have gained a predominant market share. Competing against them with an independent web store is feasible only for niche products.But why do you need to fight against these behemoths, if they offer the opportunities to sell on their platforms, with access to their large pool of customers and even their e-commerce infrastructures?These international marketplaces can be considered just as sales channels, additional to your main web store.If you are planning to launch a web store, it is highly recommended to evaluate whether it is more profitable and fast to build a store solely on a large market leader marketplace.International marketplaces are the easiest access to new markets. If you are planning to expand to other countries, launching stores in large e-commerce marketplaces gives you the possibilities to build the store in short time and immediate access to a fully integrated logistic infrastructure, together with a fully developed environment reach of tools to boost your sales.

Crypto
While it seems like cryptocurrency is paving a road ne’er before traveled, this isn’t true in every respect. Although striking renegade financial ground, the industry bares many similarities to other hypergrowth companies. But crypto has suffered worse press when it comes to customer service. Coinbase was condemned for a poor response after users lost thousands of dollars; Binance & Kraken have not escaped the wrath of bad reviews either. Time to mop up the damage.Robinhood added 24-hour support after negative reviews and Support.com launched an on-demand service to handle criticisms for their slow response time. But as a whole, crypto companies need to do a lot, and fast, to keep up with the adoption rate.Crypto minersCrypto ExchangeCrypto TradersCrypto WalletCrypto Payment gatewaysBlockchain financial servicesCrypto Crowdfunding

Marketplace Store
If you’re selling or thinking about selling on Amazon, eBay, Ocado, Walmart or any other marketplace around the world, you really need a partner with years of experience, deep knowledge of the marketplace and the country, full command of the country’s languages.While commerce continues to grow at a steady rate across the globe, leading marketplaces—the likes of ASOS, Zalando and Amazon—are further outpacing market growth averages. 53% of online shoppers are making purchases on marketplaces three or more times per month. One in five people gathers information on Amazon before making an in-store purchase. And Amazon isn’t the only big player on the marketplace scene: Alibaba, AliExpress, Bol.com, OTTO, and even eBay to name just a few. Digital marketplaces are ubiquitous, and their presence is growing steadily.Marketplaces can, therefore, offer you access to a huge base of both existing and new customers. Unsure where to start? Wondering about the best pricing strategy or how to stay on brand? We’re happy to help you get started or to get further.E-commerce marketplaces present opportunities that cannot be ignored. All major and medium size markets have grown to a stage where one or few large marketplaces have gained a predominant market share. Competing against them with an independent web store is feasible only for niche products.But why do you need to fight against these behemoths, if they offer the opportunities to sell on their platforms, with access to their large pool of customers and even their e-commerce infrastructures?These international marketplaces can be considered just as sales channels, additional to your main web store.If you are planning to launch a web store, it is highly recommended to evaluate whether it is more profitable and fast to build a store solely on a large market leader marketplace.International marketplaces are the easiest access to new markets. If you are planning to expand to other countries, launching stores in large e-commerce marketplaces gives you the possibilities to build the store in short time and immediate access to a fully integrated logistic infrastructure, together with a fully developed environment reach of tools to boost your sales.

SaaS
In a SaaS company, providing great Customer Support is the key to growth and success. Possibly it is more true for a SaaS company than for any other type of business.Although almost all customer support best practices apply to SaaS customer support, there is one fact about SaaS that changes the whole support experience: SaaS means your product is a tool that needs to be learned.If this is the reason that is keeping you aback to embrace the benefits of outsourcing The Customer Service operation, Maxximize is here to swipe away all your concerns, in the only possible way: a Customer Service Team highly experienced in SaaS business, running the Customer Service for multiple successful SaaS companies.SaaS customer support plays a part in reputation, brand image, loyalty, and customer satisfaction. It’s more than just understanding the functionality of the product, solving bugs, and handling technical issues. It’s about being alongside customers throughout their journey and ensuring they have a positive experience — starting before the sale is even made.SaaS customer support starts with helping prospectsWhen SaaS prospects visit your website, they generally start out on the self-service path. They check out your website, but then they start to have questions. Many will go to the FAQ page to find answers to basic questions, and if you’ve done a good job they will be satisfied.But what if prospects don’t find an answer to their question? That’s when live service becomes a necessity.To ensure prospects have access to instant contact, it’s useful to have live chat, phone, and visual engagement options available. Human-to-human contact reduces customer frustration and enables your business to deliver a good customer experience.Live engagement also helps you learn more about your prospects, including discovering their business needs and problems. The more you know about your prospects, the easier it becomes to develop a demo that meets their specific needs.Once a prospect is ready to move from a trial to a buying phase, you need to be prepared to offer live support. During the onboarding process, walk them through all the steps from signup to activation to training. This can help decrease the drop off rate and ensure a friction-free experience. This extra effort upfront can have long-term benefits, including:Better engagementReduced churnDecrease in future support callsCustomer empowermentThe work for SaaS customer service employees doesn’t end with onboarding. Churn rate is a constant threat.The first step in assuring your customers will remain with you is to monitor what your users are doing and learn where they’re failing and succeeding in the application. There are software solutions that can help with behavioral analysis. The knowledge you can gain from this type of software gives you the opportunity to uncover key problems without waiting for the customer to complain or get frustrated.Customer Relationship Management (CRM)Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)CMS and e-commerce platformsAccounting solutionsProject ManagementEmail MarketingCommunication and Collaboration PlatformsHR/HRM solutions

SaaS
In a SaaS company, providing great Customer Support is the key to growth and success. Possibly it is more true for a SaaS company than for any other type of business.Although almost all customer support best practices apply to SaaS customer support, there is one fact about SaaS that changes the whole support experience: SaaS means your product is a tool that needs to be learned.If this is the reason that is keeping you aback to embrace the benefits of outsourcing The Customer Service operation, Maxximize is here to swipe away all your concerns, in the only possible way: a Customer Service Team highly experienced in SaaS business, running the Customer Service for multiple successful SaaS companies.SaaS customer support plays a part in reputation, brand image, loyalty, and customer satisfaction. It’s more than just understanding the functionality of the product, solving bugs, and handling technical issues. It’s about being alongside customers throughout their journey and ensuring they have a positive experience — starting before the sale is even made.SaaS customer support starts with helping prospectsWhen SaaS prospects visit your website, they generally start out on the self-service path. They check out your website, but then they start to have questions. Many will go to the FAQ page to find answers to basic questions, and if you’ve done a good job they will be satisfied.But what if prospects don’t find an answer to their question? That’s when live service becomes a necessity.To ensure prospects have access to instant contact, it’s useful to have live chat, phone, and visual engagement options available. Human-to-human contact reduces customer frustration and enables your business to deliver a good customer experience.Live engagement also helps you learn more about your prospects, including discovering their business needs and problems. The more you know about your prospects, the easier it becomes to develop a demo that meets their specific needs.Once a prospect is ready to move from a trial to a buying phase, you need to be prepared to offer live support. During the onboarding process, walk them through all the steps from signup to activation to training. This can help decrease the drop off rate and ensure a friction-free experience. This extra effort upfront can have long-term benefits, including:Better engagementReduced churnDecrease in future support callsCustomer empowermentThe work for SaaS customer service employees doesn’t end with onboarding. Churn rate is a constant threat.The first step in assuring your customers will remain with you is to monitor what your users are doing and learn where they’re failing and succeeding in the application. There are software solutions that can help with behavioral analysis. The knowledge you can gain from this type of software gives you the opportunity to uncover key problems without waiting for the customer to complain or get frustrated.Customer Relationship Management (CRM)Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)CMS and e-commerce platformsAccounting solutionsProject ManagementEmail MarketingCommunication and Collaboration PlatformsHR/HRM solutions

Marketplace Store
If you’re selling or thinking about selling on Amazon, eBay, Ocado, Walmart or any other marketplace around the world, you really need a partner with years of experience, deep knowledge of the marketplace and the country, full command of the country’s languages.While commerce continues to grow at a steady rate across the globe, leading marketplaces—the likes of ASOS, Zalando and Amazon—are further outpacing market growth averages. 53% of online shoppers are making purchases on marketplaces three or more times per month. One in five people gathers information on Amazon before making an in-store purchase. And Amazon isn’t the only big player on the marketplace scene: Alibaba, AliExpress, Bol.com, OTTO, and even eBay to name just a few. Digital marketplaces are ubiquitous, and their presence is growing steadily.Marketplaces can, therefore, offer you access to a huge base of both existing and new customers. Unsure where to start? Wondering about the best pricing strategy or how to stay on brand? We’re happy to help you get started or to get further.E-commerce marketplaces present opportunities that cannot be ignored. All major and medium size markets have grown to a stage where one or few large marketplaces have gained a predominant market share. Competing against them with an independent web store is feasible only for niche products.But why do you need to fight against these behemoths, if they offer the opportunities to sell on their platforms, with access to their large pool of customers and even their e-commerce infrastructures?These international marketplaces can be considered just as sales channels, additional to your main web store.If you are planning to launch a web store, it is highly recommended to evaluate whether it is more profitable and fast to build a store solely on a large market leader marketplace.International marketplaces are the easiest access to new markets. If you are planning to expand to other countries, launching stores in large e-commerce marketplaces gives you the possibilities to build the store in short time and immediate access to a fully integrated logistic infrastructure, together with a fully developed environment reach of tools to boost your sales.

While it seems like cryptocurrency is paving a road ne’er before traveled, this isn’t true in every respect. Although striking renegade financial ground, the industry bares many similarities to other hypergrowth companies. But crypto has suffered worse press when it comes to customer service. Coinbase was condemned for a poor response after users lost thousands of dollars; Binance & Kraken have not escaped the wrath of bad reviews either. Time to mop up the damage.Robinhood added 24-hour support after negative reviews and Support.com launched an on-demand service to handle criticisms for their slow response time. But as a whole, crypto companies need to do a lot, and fast, to keep up with the adoption rate.Crypto minersCrypto ExchangeCrypto TradersCrypto WalletCrypto Payment gatewaysBlockchain financial servicesCrypto Crowdfunding

SaaS
In a SaaS company, providing great Customer Support is the key to growth and success. Possibly it is more true for a SaaS company than for any other type of business.Although almost all customer support best practices apply to SaaS customer support, there is one fact about SaaS that changes the whole support experience: SaaS means your product is a tool that needs to be learned.If this is the reason that is keeping you aback to embrace the benefits of outsourcing The Customer Service operation, Maxximize is here to swipe away all your concerns, in the only possible way: a Customer Service Team highly experienced in SaaS business, running the Customer Service for multiple successful SaaS companies.SaaS customer support plays a part in reputation, brand image, loyalty, and customer satisfaction. It’s more than just understanding the functionality of the product, solving bugs, and handling technical issues. It’s about being alongside customers throughout their journey and ensuring they have a positive experience — starting before the sale is even made.SaaS customer support starts with helping prospectsWhen SaaS prospects visit your website, they generally start out on the self-service path. They check out your website, but then they start to have questions. Many will go to the FAQ page to find answers to basic questions, and if you’ve done a good job they will be satisfied.But what if prospects don’t find an answer to their question? That’s when live service becomes a necessity.To ensure prospects have access to instant contact, it’s useful to have live chat, phone, and visual engagement options available. Human-to-human contact reduces customer frustration and enables your business to deliver a good customer experience.Live engagement also helps you learn more about your prospects, including discovering their business needs and problems. The more you know about your prospects, the easier it becomes to develop a demo that meets their specific needs.Once a prospect is ready to move from a trial to a buying phase, you need to be prepared to offer live support. During the onboarding process, walk them through all the steps from signup to activation to training. This can help decrease the drop off rate and ensure a friction-free experience. This extra effort upfront can have long-term benefits, including:Better engagementReduced churnDecrease in future support callsCustomer empowermentThe work for SaaS customer service employees doesn’t end with onboarding. Churn rate is a constant threat.The first step in assuring your customers will remain with you is to monitor what your users are doing and learn where they’re failing and succeeding in the application. There are software solutions that can help with behavioral analysis. The knowledge you can gain from this type of software gives you the opportunity to uncover key problems without waiting for the customer to complain or get frustrated.Customer Relationship Management (CRM)Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)CMS and e-commerce platformsAccounting solutionsProject ManagementEmail MarketingCommunication and Collaboration PlatformsHR/HRM solutions

Marketplace Store
If you’re selling or thinking about selling on Amazon, eBay, Ocado, Walmart or any other marketplace around the world, you really need a partner with years of experience, deep knowledge of the marketplace and the country, full command of the country’s languages.While commerce continues to grow at a steady rate across the globe, leading marketplaces—the likes of ASOS, Zalando and Amazon—are further outpacing market growth averages. 53% of online shoppers are making purchases on marketplaces three or more times per month. One in five people gathers information on Amazon before making an in-store purchase. And Amazon isn’t the only big player on the marketplace scene: Alibaba, AliExpress, Bol.com, OTTO, and even eBay to name just a few. Digital marketplaces are ubiquitous, and their presence is growing steadily.Marketplaces can, therefore, offer you access to a huge base of both existing and new customers. Unsure where to start? Wondering about the best pricing strategy or how to stay on brand? We’re happy to help you get started or to get further.E-commerce marketplaces present opportunities that cannot be ignored. All major and medium size markets have grown to a stage where one or few large marketplaces have gained a predominant market share. Competing against them with an independent web store is feasible only for niche products.But why do you need to fight against these behemoths, if they offer the opportunities to sell on their platforms, with access to their large pool of customers and even their e-commerce infrastructures?These international marketplaces can be considered just as sales channels, additional to your main web store.If you are planning to launch a web store, it is highly recommended to evaluate whether it is more profitable and fast to build a store solely on a large market leader marketplace.International marketplaces are the easiest access to new markets. If you are planning to expand to other countries, launching stores in large e-commerce marketplaces gives you the possibilities to build the store in short time and immediate access to a fully integrated logistic infrastructure, together with a fully developed environment reach of tools to boost your sales.

Crypto
While it seems like cryptocurrency is paving a road ne’er before traveled, this isn’t true in every respect. Although striking renegade financial ground, the industry bares many similarities to other hypergrowth companies. But crypto has suffered worse press when it comes to customer service. Coinbase was condemned for a poor response after users lost thousands of dollars; Binance & Kraken have not escaped the wrath of bad reviews either. Time to mop up the damage.Robinhood added 24-hour support after negative reviews and Support.com launched an on-demand service to handle criticisms for their slow response time. But as a whole, crypto companies need to do a lot, and fast, to keep up with the adoption rate.Crypto minersCrypto ExchangeCrypto TradersCrypto WalletCrypto Payment gatewaysBlockchain financial servicesCrypto Crowdfunding

We analyze, dig out the meaningful data and use them to build new processes.

SaaS
In a SaaS company, providing great Customer Support is the key to growth and success. Possibly it is more true for a SaaS company than for any other type of business.Although almost all customer support best practices apply to SaaS customer support, there is one fact about SaaS that changes the whole support experience: SaaS means your product is a tool that needs to be learned.If this is the reason that is keeping you aback to embrace the benefits of outsourcing The Customer Service operation, Maxximize is here to swipe away all your concerns, in the only possible way: a Customer Service Team highly experienced in SaaS business, running the Customer Service for multiple successful SaaS companies.SaaS customer support plays a part in reputation, brand image, loyalty, and customer satisfaction. It’s more than just understanding the functionality of the product, solving bugs, and handling technical issues. It’s about being alongside customers throughout their journey and ensuring they have a positive experience — starting before the sale is even made.SaaS customer support starts with helping prospectsWhen SaaS prospects visit your website, they generally start out on the self-service path. They check out your website, but then they start to have questions. Many will go to the FAQ page to find answers to basic questions, and if you’ve done a good job they will be satisfied.But what if prospects don’t find an answer to their question? That’s when live service becomes a necessity.To ensure prospects have access to instant contact, it’s useful to have live chat, phone, and visual engagement options available. Human-to-human contact reduces customer frustration and enables your business to deliver a good customer experience.Live engagement also helps you learn more about your prospects, including discovering their business needs and problems. The more you know about your prospects, the easier it becomes to develop a demo that meets their specific needs.Once a prospect is ready to move from a trial to a buying phase, you need to be prepared to offer live support. During the onboarding process, walk them through all the steps from signup to activation to training. This can help decrease the drop off rate and ensure a friction-free experience. This extra effort upfront can have long-term benefits, including:Better engagementReduced churnDecrease in future support callsCustomer empowermentThe work for SaaS customer service employees doesn’t end with onboarding. Churn rate is a constant threat.The first step in assuring your customers will remain with you is to monitor what your users are doing and learn where they’re failing and succeeding in the application. There are software solutions that can help with behavioral analysis. The knowledge you can gain from this type of software gives you the opportunity to uncover key problems without waiting for the customer to complain or get frustrated.Customer Relationship Management (CRM)Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)CMS and e-commerce platformsAccounting solutionsProject ManagementEmail MarketingCommunication and Collaboration PlatformsHR/HRM solutions

Marketplace Store
If you’re selling or thinking about selling on Amazon, eBay, Ocado, Walmart or any other marketplace around the world, you really need a partner with years of experience, deep knowledge of the marketplace and the country, full command of the country’s languages.While commerce continues to grow at a steady rate across the globe, leading marketplaces—the likes of ASOS, Zalando and Amazon—are further outpacing market growth averages. 53% of online shoppers are making purchases on marketplaces three or more times per month. One in five people gathers information on Amazon before making an in-store purchase. And Amazon isn’t the only big player on the marketplace scene: Alibaba, AliExpress, Bol.com, OTTO, and even eBay to name just a few. Digital marketplaces are ubiquitous, and their presence is growing steadily.Marketplaces can, therefore, offer you access to a huge base of both existing and new customers. Unsure where to start? Wondering about the best pricing strategy or how to stay on brand? We’re happy to help you get started or to get further.E-commerce marketplaces present opportunities that cannot be ignored. All major and medium size markets have grown to a stage where one or few large marketplaces have gained a predominant market share. Competing against them with an independent web store is feasible only for niche products.But why do you need to fight against these behemoths, if they offer the opportunities to sell on their platforms, with access to their large pool of customers and even their e-commerce infrastructures?These international marketplaces can be considered just as sales channels, additional to your main web store.If you are planning to launch a web store, it is highly recommended to evaluate whether it is more profitable and fast to build a store solely on a large market leader marketplace.International marketplaces are the easiest access to new markets. If you are planning to expand to other countries, launching stores in large e-commerce marketplaces gives you the possibilities to build the store in short time and immediate access to a fully integrated logistic infrastructure, together with a fully developed environment reach of tools to boost your sales.

Crypto
While it seems like cryptocurrency is paving a road ne’er before traveled, this isn’t true in every respect. Although striking renegade financial ground, the industry bares many similarities to other hypergrowth companies. But crypto has suffered worse press when it comes to customer service. Coinbase was condemned for a poor response after users lost thousands of dollars; Binance & Kraken have not escaped the wrath of bad reviews either. Time to mop up the damage.Robinhood added 24-hour support after negative reviews and Support.com launched an on-demand service to handle criticisms for their slow response time. But as a whole, crypto companies need to do a lot, and fast, to keep up with the adoption rate.Crypto minersCrypto ExchangeCrypto TradersCrypto WalletCrypto Payment gatewaysBlockchain financial servicesCrypto Crowdfunding
