I provided PayPal with my information, but they  did not proceed with payment processing either.   They redirected me back to your merchant page. Just so that I could put payment info into the system all over again.  Just so that they can redirect me back to PayPal but to no avail. I’ve never had this problem before. And it’s truly frustrating.   I’m usually able to pay with my credit card with no discrepancies. This over an hour long process has become very draining. And I need some type of support to resolve this issue. So that I can make the purchase.

{"prompt":" Company: PayStabs\n User name: George\n Subject: TPS - Contact Form\n Question: I just placed an order for a W2 form. Everything looked good on the version I was going to print but the actual PDF you sent me listed only 45.00 for wages tips and compensation and 2.00 for my Social Security benefits when the real numbers should have been $45,000 and $2,700  I assume that it happened because I added the comma in 45,000 instead of 45000 and 2,700 instead of 2700  The problem is that I now have a W2 showing 45.00 in income and 2.00 in social security. How can I generate my W2 again, this time not using the comma... I have always included a comma in numbers presented and I thought I could include it here. I can do without it but I need to have a W2 with the correct numbers. Can you please let me generate a new one with the correct info?  Thank you, I am stuck without a W2 and need your help. \n\n","completion":" Hi George,  Thank you for contacting us     Unfortunately, we are not able to change the amount on your W-2 Form from our end in this case you will have to place a new replacement order with the correct numbers and after placing a new replacement order you can let us know your order number as the initial and recent order numbers and we will refund you for the initial order after verifying the purchase     Feel free to contact us for further assistance     Regards,  Brett Martin "}

{"prompt":" Company: PayStabs\n User name: Chelsea Thompson\n Subject: Refund request for multiple orders\n Question: Greetings,  Thank you for the service you provide; it is highly valuable to small start-up companies like ours. I made a mistake on the first seven W2s I processed. I am hoping you can help a small business out by issuing a refund for some or all of these charges.  In field 15, I put our state ID, not our state WITHHOLDING ID.  Additionally, I calculated the wages at a rate of 18 weeks instead of 17 weeks. I revised all of these with the correct State WTH ID, and the gross wage number is slightly lower that the first order since the gross wages were less one week. It would be incredibly appreciated if you could verify the changes and issue a refund for some or all of the mistaken W2s. I would be ever grateful, and willing to submit a glowing review of course. Please advise.  Incorrect W2s:                   Corrected W2s: w2-1473480                        w2-1475175 W2-1473567                       W2-1475200 W2-1474161                       W2-1475202 W2-1474203                       W2-1475208 W2-1474218                       W2-1475213 W2-1474276                       W2-1475218 W2-1474284                       W2-1475222  Attached are screenshots of the charges coming out of our account. Screenshot #1 has two charges; Screenshot #2 has five charges, and the last screenshot shows the CORRECT charges for the corrections I made. We are looking to have the first seven charges reversed if possible.
